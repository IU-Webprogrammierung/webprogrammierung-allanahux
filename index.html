      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Allanah, 26, originally from the north of Germany near Hamburg. In
        2022 I moved to Mannheim to be with my partner, and over time I
        discovered a new sense of home in the south. <br />
        Photography has always been part of my world. My grandfather collected
        cameras and passed on his love for capturing moments. As a teenager I
        occasionally played with his old analog models, but it wasn’t until 2024
        that I truly dared to step into photography myself. Since then, it has
        become the way I slow down, notice details, and tell stories through
        images. <br />
        Design is the other path I’ve chosen. In 2022, I began studying User
        Experience Design, fascinated by the balance between creativity,
        psychology, and human needs. Today, both photography and design shape
        how I see the world – and how I create within it.
