    <section id="about">
      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Allanah, 26, originally from the north of Germany near Hamburg. In
        2022 I moved to Mannheim to be with my partner, and over time I
        discovered a new sense of home in the south. Photography has always been
        part of my world. My grandfather collected cameras and passed on his
        love for capturing moments. As a teenager I occasionally played with his
        old analog models, but it wasn’t until 2024 that I truly dared to step
        into photography myself. Since then, it has become the way I slow down,
        notice details, and tell stories through images. Design is the other
        path I’ve chosen. In 2022, I began studying User Experience Design,
        fascinated by the balance between creativity, psychology, and human
        needs. Today, both photography and design shape how I see the world –
        and how I create within it.
